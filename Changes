CPAN-ification of an old module

* Packaging changed from Debian-style to CPAN style (use dh-make-perl
  if you want a Debian package)
* Namespace changed from SCSI to Device::SCSI to fit CPAN conventions
* Modules are now actually versioned
* A simple test added to make CPAN testers happy

--- Before CPAN-ification 2003-10-16

There was a bug in SCSI::linux::enumerate() where it used stat() instead of
lstat() to check if a file in /dev was a SCSI generic device. This meant
that in some cases, symlinks to devices would show up rather than the
devices themselves.
