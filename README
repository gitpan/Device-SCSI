ABSTRACT
========

THis is a module that provides generic SCSI access to SCSI and
SCSI-like devices (e.g. USB mass-storage devices) under Linux. A
script that performs reading raw CDDA audio ("CD ripping") is provided
as an example.

The module is designed to be generic and OS-neutral, however only a
Linux backend has been written so far.

INSTALLATION
============

a) Untar the archive
b) cd into the directory created: SCSI-x.xx
c) Makefile.PL
d) make
e) make install

USAGE
